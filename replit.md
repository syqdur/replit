# Wedding Gallery App

## Overview

This is a full-stack wedding gallery application built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The app provides an Instagram-style interface for wedding guests to share photos, videos, and messages during the wedding celebration. It features real-time interactions, Spotify integration for music requests, and comprehensive admin controls.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite for development and building
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **External Services**: Firebase for media storage and real-time features, Spotify API for music integration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for a modern, responsive design

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React Components**: Modular component structure with proper TypeScript typing
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state, custom hooks for shared logic
- **Routing**: Single-page application with client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with dark mode support and responsive design

### Backend Architecture
- **Express Server**: RESTful API structure with middleware for logging and error handling
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for type-safe database operations
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer supporting both in-memory and database implementations
- **Authentication**: Simple username-based authentication system

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Stores user credentials with unique usernames
- **Schema Definition**: Located in `shared/schema.ts` for type sharing between client and server
- **Migrations**: Drizzle migrations in the `migrations` directory

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users provide usernames which are stored locally and used for session management
2. **Media Upload**: Files uploaded to Firebase Storage with metadata stored in Firestore
3. **Real-time Updates**: Firebase Firestore provides real-time synchronization for comments, likes, and stories
4. **API Communication**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on user data
5. **External Integrations**: Spotify API for music playlist management
